				<h3>EU GDPR Law</h3>
				<p>
All UK websites need to comply with the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) that require a message or warning must be displayed and made clear to visitors to your site that cookies are being used.
</p><p>
On your first visit, we have displayed a message to warn you that our website makes use of cookies and offering the choice to deny their use. The message will be displayed until such time as you deny or allow our site to use cookies by clicking on the relevant button. We will store a cookie with your preference so on subsequent visits, a "Cookies" button will show in the top left corner for you to change your preference if required.<br />

<h3>What is a cookie?</h3>
<p>A cookie is a small amount of data, often including a unique identifier, sent to the browser of your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a "device") from our webserver.
It is stored on your device as a hidden text file and each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it.
</p><p>
To protect your privacy, your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, and not the cookies sent to you by other websites. Many websites do this whenever a user visits them to track online traffic flows and online shopping baskets.
</p><p>
On this website, our cookies record information about your visit so we can tailor the website to your device screen and register "hits" on pages you view. 
You can set your device’s preferences to accept all cookies, notify you when a cookie is issued, or not receive cookies at all. Selecting the last option means you will not receive certain personalised features, which may result in you being unable to take full advantage of all the website's features. Each browser is different, so please check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.
</p><p>
During the course of any visit to our website, every page you see, along with a cookie, is downloaded to your device. Many websites do this to do things like find out whether your device (and probably you) has visited the website before. On a repeat visit this is done by the webserver finding the cookie left there on the last visit.
</p>
<h3>How do we use cookies?</h3>
<p>Information supplied by cookies can help us analyse the profile of our visitors, which helps us provide you with a better user experience. For example, if on a previous visit you decided to hide a certain feature, we might find this out from your cookie and restore your preferences on your next visit.
</p>
<h3>Third party cookies on our pages</h3>
<p>During your visits to our website/app, you may notice some cookies which are unrelated to us. When you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" title="View Google Privacy Policy">Google</a>, or <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/privacy-and-cookies/" title="View TfL Privacy Policy">Transport for London</a>, you may be presented with cookies from these websites. We do not control the dissemination of these cookies and you should check the links for more information about these.
</p>
<h3>Cookies used on our site</h3>
<p>Our main use of cookies is to help provide navigation and mobile responsive views on a variety of devices. We want you to enjoy your visit and cookies enable a pleasant, fluid browsing experience. Here is a list of cookies used on this website:
<ul>
<li>Google Analytics - we use cookies to compile visitor statistics such as how many people have visited our website, what type of technology they are using (e.g. Mac or Windows which helps to identify when our site isn’t working as it should for particular technologies), how long they spend on the site, what page they look at etc.
</li>
<li>Remember user preferences for Video/Image feeds</li>
<li>Remember user preferences for selected Bus Stops</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>How to delete cookies or control them</h3>
